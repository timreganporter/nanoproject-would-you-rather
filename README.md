This project is Tim Regan-Porter's final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

Udacity provided a _DATA.js file with sample data and functions to mimic asyncronous api calls, in addition to a number of requirements for applicaiton behavior.

I used this project to also add more experience with Semantic UI and their React itegration, to build declarative routing functionality to require authentication for routes, to build a flash message set of components that removes messages after a certain amount of time, and try out other packages like shortid and react-text-truncate (in addition to redux-thunk, react-redux-loading, and others used in earlier Udacity projects).
